# Base API Example

This API example is a framework for a gRPC API with a REST Gateway. It supports gRPC or HTTP/REST on the same port.

## Compiling
This is designed as a go module aware program and thus requires go 1.11 or better
You can clone it anywhere, just run `make` inside the cloned directory to build

## Requirements
This does require a postgres database to be setup and reachable. It will attempt to create and migrate the database upon starting.

## Configuration
The configuration can be specified in a number of ways. By default you can create a json or yaml file and call it with the -c option
you can also specify environment variables that align with the config file values.

Example:
```json
{
	"logger": {
        "level": "debug"
	}
}
```
Can be set via an environment variable:
```
LOGGER_LEVEL=debug
```

## Data Storage
Data is stored in a postgres database

## TLS/HTTPS
You can enable https by setting the config option server.tls = true and pointing it to your keyfile and certfile.
To create a self-signed cert: `openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3650 -nodes -x509 -keyout server.key -out server.crt`
It also has the option to automatically generate a development cert every time it runs using the server.devcert option.

## Relocation
If you want to start with this as boilerplate for your project, you can clone this repo and use the `make relocate` option to rename the package.
`make relocate TARGET=github.com/myname/mycoolproject`
